# Assignment 4.

## Chapter 9 - Arrays

## Chapter 10 - Dictionaries.

A Dictionary is a collection type that organizes its content by key-value pairs. The keys in a dictionary map onto values. A key is like the ticket you give to the attendant at a coat check.

You hand your ticket over, and the attendant uses it to find your coat. Similarly, you give a key to an instance of the Dictionary type, and it returns to you the value associated with that key.

The keys in a Dictionary must be unique. This requirement means that every key will uniquely map onto its value.
